# learn-travis/ Continuous integration

Continuous integration is a software development practice in which members of
a team integrate their work frequently - usually one or more times per day.
Each integration is verified by an automated build, including tests. This makes
it much easier to integrate when compared to rare integration, where there
could be an overwhelming number of conflicts and issues which arise as a result
of integrating.

## Travis
Travis is a continuous integration tool. It runs a set of tests for you
automatically when you push them to your remote repository. These can be tests
if the usual sense, and you can also set it up to fail if the codebase doesn't
meet your litning rules.
